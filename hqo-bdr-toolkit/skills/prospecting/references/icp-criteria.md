# ICP Criteria & Tiering

## Target Segments

Owner-operators, third-party property managers, institutional capital/investors.

## Asset Class Priority

Commercial Office → Mixed-Use → Luxury Residential (residential is secondary).

## Deal Size Tiering

Formula: `portfolio_sf × $0.04/sf = estimated deal size`

| Tier | Deal Size | Portfolio SF | Priority |
|------|-----------|-------------|----------|
| 1 | $1M+ | 33.3M+ sf | Highest — enterprise play |
| 2 | $250K–$999K | 8.3M–33.2M sf | High — core target |
| 3 | $75K–$249K | 2.5M–8.2M sf | Medium — solid opportunity |
| 4 | <$75K | <2.5M sf | Low — qualify carefully |

## Timing Triggers

Look for these signals in Clay news/enrichment results:

- **Press/Awards** — Recent recognition, industry awards, "best workplace" lists
- **Leadership changes** — New hires or promotions in Asset Management, Property Management, or Experience roles
- **Construction/Renovations** — Active repositioning, lobby renovations, amenity buildouts
- **Portfolio moves** — Acquisitions, dispositions, new fund launches
- **Tenant events** — Major lease signings, co-working expansions, tenant programming announcements

## Disqualification Signals

- Portfolio entirely industrial/retail (no office, mixed-use, or luxury resi)
- Company is an existing HqO customer (check HubSpot lifecyclestage)
- Company recently acquired by existing HqO customer
- Sub-1M sf portfolio with no growth signals
