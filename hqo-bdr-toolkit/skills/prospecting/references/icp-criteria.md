# ICP Criteria & Tiering

## Target Segments

Owner-operators, third-party property managers, institutional capital/investors.

## Asset Class Priority

Commercial Office → Mixed-Use → Luxury Residential (residential is secondary).

## Deal Size Tiering

Formula: `portfolio_sf × $0.04/sf = estimated deal size`

| Tier | Deal Size | Portfolio SF | Priority |
|------|-----------|-------------|----------|
| 1 | $1M+ | 33.3M+ sf | Highest — enterprise play |
| 2 | $250K–$999K | 8.3M–33.2M sf | High — core target |
| 3 | $75K–$249K | 2.5M–8.2M sf | Medium — solid opportunity |
| 4 | <$75K | <2.5M sf | Low — qualify carefully |

## Timing Triggers

Look for these signals in Clay news/enrichment results:

- **Press/Awards** — Recent recognition, industry awards, "best workplace" lists
- **Leadership changes** — New hires or promotions in Asset Management, Property Management, or Experience roles
- **Construction/Renovations** — Active repositioning, lobby renovations, amenity buildouts
- **Portfolio moves** — Acquisitions, dispositions, new fund launches
- **Tenant events** — Major lease signings, co-working expansions, tenant programming announcements

## Owner-Influence Validation

When Ozzy or initial research flags a company as "investor/syndicator" or "not an owner-operator," do **NOT** automatically disqualify. Instead, run this secondary assessment using whatever data is available from Ozzy's research, Clay, and HubSpot:

### 1. Ownership Stake Analysis

Research the company's actual equity positions in recent deals. A historical reputation for minority stakes may not reflect current strategy. Look for:
- Deals where they hold **30%+ interests**
- Listings as **lead principal** on assets
- Evidence they are **signing leases directly** with tenants

### 2. Operating Behavior Signals

Check if the company is doing any of the following — these indicate owner-operator behavior even without an in-house PM team:
- Signing or renewing tenant leases directly
- Investing in building amenities or capital improvements
- Driving expansion/redevelopment plans
- Issuing press releases about tenant activity

### 3. PM Partner Mapping

Identify the property management companies operating assets on behalf of this investor. Each PM partner is a **derivative lead**. Note:
- The specific assets they manage
- The SF under management per PM partner

### 4. Asset-Level Filtering

Separate the portfolio into:
- **(a)** Assets remaining as office/commercial
- **(b)** Assets converting to residential or other non-target uses

Only evaluate the **office-remaining bucket** for ICP fit.

### 5. Influence Assessment

For assets where the company holds significant equity (30%+), note that **owners can influence technology platform decisions** even when a third-party PM handles day-to-day operations. Flag these as **"owner-influence opportunities"** rather than disqualifying them.

### Minimum Score Rule

If the company has **3M+ SF of office assets remaining** in their portfolio (across any ownership structure), they should score **no lower than 5/10** regardless of their operating model, with the recommendation **"Evaluate PM Partners"** rather than "Do Not Pursue."

## Disqualification Signals

- Portfolio entirely industrial/retail (no office, mixed-use, or luxury resi)
- Company is an existing HqO customer (check HubSpot lifecyclestage)
- Company recently acquired by existing HqO customer
- Sub-1M sf portfolio with no growth signals
